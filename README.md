# Zebra

The main purpose of this finance app is to give users insight to where their money is going. This will be done by showing graphs of different types/categories of where money has been spent. Users will be able to filter their bank statement (csv) by date, category, and amount, which most banking apps don't show. Eventually, my goal is to add more features such that users could compare 2 bank statements against each other to see if there was an increase/decrease in spending in a specific category. 

This repository is dedicated to the development of the categorization algorithm which will eventually be integrated within the Spring Boot backend. 
So far there is a barebones frontend which includes a login/signup/dashboard page, once the categorization algorithm is complete, I will touch up the frontend and
have the apps communicate through a REST API. 

Here is a picture of the frontend so far!
